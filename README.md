# Progress

- Created initial project structure through create new project with the plugin
- Currently trying to import and use a DateTime library to feel how library dependencies work 

# Findings

- Compose multiplatform desktop app plugin creates a template for your desktop app
- Main entry point for apps code is in Main.kt with a starting function main() that starts the aoo
- build.gradle.kts acts as the settings file for dependencies and resources

- Kotlin Multiplatform and Compose multiplatform are different but similar things, compose multiplatform is built on top of kotlin multiplatform but allows sharing of business logic like kotlin multiplatform along with UI logic
